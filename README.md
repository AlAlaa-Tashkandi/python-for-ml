# Learning Basics of Python for Machine Learning

The goal of this project is to understand the basics of python language to achieve simple Machine Learning Project. I use it as a reference for me if I forgot the syntax for specific feature in python, for instance, while loop or dictionaries.


## Resources

* I learned most of the contents of this project from Udacity extra curriculum lessons about the basics of python as part of Basics of Machine Learning Nano Degree program. For more info, click [here](https://www.udacity.com)


## Usage

**_A prerequisite_** for using this project is the availability of jupyter notebook.
* cd to the cloned project
* jupyter notebook
* open MLpython.ipynb
* go through the code, test it and enjoy.
* you may use it as a cheat sheet by searching for specific keyword. Instead of googling it, just find it in the in the project and test it immediately.

## How to Contribute

Add additional examples and basics of python code required to start writing Machine Learning code.
